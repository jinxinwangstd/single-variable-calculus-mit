# Lecture 6: Exponential and Log

Exponential functions:

We have a base $a$. Then we have $a^0 = 1$, $a^1 = a$, $a^2 = a \cdot a$, and so on.

Then we know the following property for exponential functions:

$a^{x_1 + x_2} = a^{x_1} \cdot a^{x_2}$

$a^{x_1 \cdot x_2} = (a^{x_1})^{x_2} = (a^{x_2})^{x_1}$

With the above properties, the exponential function values with integer powers are defined.

For rational powers, we define their values as the following property:

$a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}$

For irrational powers, we define their values by "filling in" the gaps in the exponential function to maintain continuity.

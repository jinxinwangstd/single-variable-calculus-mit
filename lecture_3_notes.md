# Lecture 3: Derivatives

There are two kinds of derivative formulas:

1. Specific formulas: derivative formulas for a specific function, like $y = x^n, n=1,2,3,...$
2. General formulas: derivative formulas for expressions, like $(u + v)'= u' + v'$.

Derivative formula for the function $\sin(x)$

$\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{\sin(x+\Delta x) - \sin(x)}{\Delta x}$
